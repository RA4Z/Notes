In [[Godot]], mesh is a type of Resource that contains vertex array-based geometry, divided in surfaces. Each surface contains a completely separate array and a material used to draw it. Design wise, a mesh with multiple surfaces is preferred to a single surface, because objects created in 3D editing software commonly contain multiple materials.
