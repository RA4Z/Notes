In [[Godot]], **Control** is the base class for all UI-related nodes. **Control** features a bounding rectangle that defines its extents, an anchor position relative to its parent control or the current viewport, and offsets relative to the anchor. The offsets update automatically when the node, any of its parents, or the screen size change.
