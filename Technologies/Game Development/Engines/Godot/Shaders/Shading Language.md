[[Godot]] uses a shading language similar to [[OpenGL ES Shading Language 3.0|GLSL ES 3.0]]. Most datatypes and functions are supported, and the few remaining ones will likely be added over time.

### Data Types
Most GLSL ES 3.0 datatypes are supported:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**void**|Void datatype, useful only for functions that return nothing.|
|**bool**|Boolean datatype, can only contain `true` or `false`.|
|**bvec2**|Two-component vector of booleans.|
|**bvec3**|Three-component vector of booleans.|
|**bvec4**|Four-component vector of booleans.|
|**int**|32 bit signed scalar integer.|
|**ivec2**|Two-component vector of signed integers.|
|**ivec3**|Three-component vector of signed integers.|
|**ivec4**|Four-component vector of signed integers.|
|**uint**|Unsigned scalar integer; can't contain negative numbers.|
|**uvec2**|Two-component vector of unsigned integers.|
|**uvec3**|Three-component vector of unsigned integers.|
|**uvec4**|Four-component vector of unsigned integers.|
|**float**|32 bit floating-point scalar.|
|**vec2**|Two-component vector of floating-point values.|
|**vec3**|Three-component vector of floating-point values.|
|**vec4**|Four-component vector of floating-point values.|
|**mat2**|2x2 matrix, in column major order.|
|**mat3**|3x3 matrix, in column major order.|
|**mat4**|4x4 matrix, in column major order.|
|**sampler2D**|Sampler type for binding 2D textures, which are read as float.|
|**isampler2D**|Sampler type for binding 2D textures, which are read as signed integer.|
|**usampler2D**|Sampler type for binding 2D textures, which are read as unsigned integer.|
|**sampler2DArray**|Sampler type for binding 2D texture arrays, which are read as float.|
|**isampler2DArray**|Sampler type for binding 2D texture arrays, which are read as signed integer.|
|**usampler2DArray**|Sampler type for binding 2D texture arrays, which are read as unsigned integer.|
|**sampler3D**|Sampler type for binding 3D textures, which are read as float.|
|**isampler3D**|Sampler type for binding 3D textures, which are read as signed integer.|
|**usampler3D**|Sampler type for binding 3D textures, which are read as unsigned integer.|
|**samplerCube**|Sampler type for binding Cubemaps, which are read as float.|
|**samplerCubeArray**|Sampler type for binding Cubemap arrays, which are read as float. Only supported in Forward+ and Mobile, not Compatibility.|
|**samplerExternalOES**|External sampler type. Only supported in Compatibility/Android platform.|
