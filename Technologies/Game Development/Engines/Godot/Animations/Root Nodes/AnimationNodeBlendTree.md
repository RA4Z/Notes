When you make an `AnimationNodeBlendTree`, you get an empty 2d graph in the bottom panel, under the [[AnimationTree]] tab. It contains only an `Output` node by default.

In order for animations to play, a node has to be connected to the output. You can add nodes from the **Add Node...** menu or by right clicking an empty space:

The simplest connection to make is to connect an `Animation` node to the output directly, which will just play back the animation.
