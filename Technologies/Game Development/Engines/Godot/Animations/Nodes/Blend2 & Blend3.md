In [[AnimationTree]], these nodes will blend between two or three inputs by a user-specified blend value:

Blending can use **filters** to control individually which tracks get blended and which do not. This can be useful for layering animations on top of each other.

For more complex blending, it is recommended to use blend spaces instead.
