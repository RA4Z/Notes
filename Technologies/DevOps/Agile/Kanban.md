Kanban is a visual project management framework within the broader agile methodology, using a Kanban board to track tasks and manage workflow.

### How it works
- **Visualize the workflow:** A board with columns representing the different stages of a project, such as "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done"
- **Move task cards:** Each task is a card that moves from left to right as work is completed
- **Limit work-in-progress:** Set a limit on the number of tasks that can be in each "In Progress" column to prevent overloading and maintain a steady flow
