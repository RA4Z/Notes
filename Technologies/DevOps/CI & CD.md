Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, is an automated process that involves frequent code integration, automated testing, and continuous deployment of software changes to production.

### How it works
- 1. **Commit and Merge (CI):** A developer commits a code change to a central repository like GitHub
- 2. **Automated Build (CI):** A CI server automatically detects the new code and builds the application from the updated code
- 3. **Automated Testing (CI):** The CI process runs automated tests to check for bugs and integration issues
- 4. **Continuous Delivery:** If the tests pass, the code is packaged and made ready for deployment to a production environment. This can happen automatically or require a manual "go" to release it
- 5. **Continuous Deployment:** The code is automatically deployed to the production environment immediately after it passes all the automated tests

This process repeats with every code change, ensuring a continuous flow from development to release
