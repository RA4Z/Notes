Is a framework for integrating security throughout the entire software development lifecycle

It extends the [[DevOps]] model by making security a shared responsibility from the beginning

### Key Principles
- **Shared responsibility:** DevSecOps promotes a culture where developers, security, specialists and operations teams collaborate and share the responsibility for security
- **Automation:** Security testing, code scanning, and other security measures are automated and integrated into the [[CI & CD|CI/CD]] pipeline
- **Continuous security:** Security is not a one-time event, with continuous monitoring and feedback loops to identify and fix issues as they arise
### Benefits
- **Faster delivery:** Security is built-in, preventing issues from causing delays and rework later in the development cycle
- **Improved security posture:** Issues are caught and fixed earlier, resulting in more secure code
