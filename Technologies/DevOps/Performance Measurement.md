It's the process to analyze the efficiency of your code or system, identifying problems and optimizing resources.

- **Profilers:** Show time of execution and memory consumption per function, in Python we use [[cProfile]] for that task
- **APMs:** They monitor applications in real time, including **throughput** (requisitions per second), **latency** and **CPU/RAM usage**
