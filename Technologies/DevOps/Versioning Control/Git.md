Git is a free, open-source **distributed version control system** designed to track changes in files, especially source code, and facilitate collaboration among developers.

Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, even offline, by maintaining a complete local copy of the project and its history.

It stores data as snapshots of the project rather than as a series of file-based changes, making it efficient and reliable.
