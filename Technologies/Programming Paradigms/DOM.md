The **DOM (Document Object Model)** is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page in a tree-like format, allowing developers to access, modify and control the content and structure of the page using languages like JavaScript. The DOM enables dynamic interaction with the web page, making it possible to change elements, attributes and styles without reloading the page.
