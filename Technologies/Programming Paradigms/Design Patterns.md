Design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common problems encountered in software design.

They act as **blueprints** or templates that can be adapted to solve specific challenges, promoting **code re-usability**, **standardization** and **efficiency**. 

### Types of Design Patterns
Design patterns are broadly classified into three categories:
#### 1. Creational Design Patterns
These patterns focus on the **creation of [[Object|objects]]** while hiding the complexities of object instantiation. They ensure flexibility and re-usability in object creation.

#### 2. Structural Design Patterns
These patterns deal with the **composition of [[Class|classes]] and [[Object|objects]]** to form larger, more flexible structures.

#### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
These patterns focus on **communication and interaction between [[Object|objects]]**, defining how they collaborate
