Deadlock is a situation in computing, particularly in systems with multiple processes, where two or more processes become blocked and unable to proceed. This occurs when each process is waiting for a resource that another process is currently using, creating a cycle of waiting. 

To prevent a deadlock, it is essential to ensure that resources are used in a mutually exclusive manner, meaning that the use of a resource must prevent the other processes from using it simultaneously.

Deadlocks can lead to system instability and require specific strategies to detect and resolve them.
