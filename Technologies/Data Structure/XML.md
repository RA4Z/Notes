**eXtensible Markup Language** is a **markup language** designed to **store, structure and transport** data in a format that is **human-readable** and **machine-readable**.

Unlike HTML, which has predefined tags for presentation, XML allows you to **create your own tags** to describe the data’s structure and meaning. This flexibility makes it ideal for **data sharing between different systems** regardless of platform or technology.

#### Example
```XML
<note>
   <to>Tove</to>
   <from>Jani</from>
   <heading>Reminder</heading>
   <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
```
