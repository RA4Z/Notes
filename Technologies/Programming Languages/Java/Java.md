Java is a highly influential, object-oriented programming language and platform known for its portability, robustness, and extensive ecosystem.

- [[Object-Oriented Programming]]: Java is built on the OOP paradigm, emphasizing concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, which promotes modularity and code reusability.
- **Extensive Ecosystem and Community**: Java boasts a massive collection of libraries (APIs), frameworks (like Spring and Hibernate), tools, and an enormous, active developer community.
- **Primary Use Cases**: Java remains dominant in **enterprise-level backend development** (server-side applications), large-scale systems, Android mobile development and complex desktop applications.
