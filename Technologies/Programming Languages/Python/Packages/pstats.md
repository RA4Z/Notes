The `pstats` is a Python [[Packages|module]] used for analyzing and formatting the statistical data collected by Python's profilers, primarily [[cProfile]]

- **Loading Profile Data:** `pstats` can load profiling data directly from a [[cProfile]] instance or from a file where [[cProfile]] has saved its output
- **Sorting and Filtering:** It provides methods to sort the collected statistics based on various criteria, such as cumulative time, total time per call, number of calls and more
- **Inspecting Function Calls:** It allows detailed examination of individual function calls, including execution times, call counts and call stack

```Python
import cProfile
import pstats

def my_function():
    sum(range(1000000))

def another_function():
    for _ in range(5):
        my_function()

# Profile the code
profiler = cProfile.Profile()
profiler.enable()
another_function()
profiler.disable()

# Create a Stats object and analyze the results
stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)

# Sort by cumulative time and print the top 10 lines
stats.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(10)
```

Basically, `pstats` provides the means to read the data generated by [[cProfile]] in a human-readable format, aiming in performance optimization efforts.
